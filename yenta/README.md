# Yenta

This directory is focused on [Yenta](https://yenta.talentbase.io/yenta).
At the beginning of 2018, they sent our activity report contains like counts, gender and generation distributions and retantion. I'm interested in this data to estimate product user distribution and clusters to optimize and design yenta usage. 

If you don't know yenta itself, please check the above link. Briefly, this service is C2C matching service. Its concept and mechanism is similar to marriage hunting service. All we have to do is swipe to the left and right on the app, then talks and make appointment with matched people.
